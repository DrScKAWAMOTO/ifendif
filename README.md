cmdrecplay
==============

`ifendif` is a tool for reporting valid lines by #if #endif directives, with C/C++
language source codes. It uses cmdrecplay and clang cc1 as the backend then refers to
the macro definitions at compile time to judge validity.

How to build
------------

ifendif should be quite portable on UNIX OSs, it has been tested on FreeBSD,
Linux and OS X only.

### Prerequisites

1. ANSI **C++ compiler** to compile the sources.
2. **cmake** to configure the build process.
3. **pkg-config** to find dependencies during configure step.
4. **make** to run the build. Makefiles are generated by `cmake`.
5. **libconfig** to parse the config file. (Version shall be greater than 1.4)
6. **cmdrecplay** to execute ifendif.
7. **clang** to execute ifendif.

### Build commands

It could be the best to build it in a separate build directory.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make all
    make package # to make packages
    sudo make install # to install

You can configure the build process with passing arguments to cmake.
For example, debug configuration is the follows,

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    make all


How to use
----------

After installation, install cmdrecplay and clang too.

First, compile your soruce codes by,

    cmdrec clang -D...<etc> your_source_code.c

or

    cmdrec make

Next, execute ifendif

    ifendif your_source_code.c
